Flow Duration Index
================

*Dimensionless index indicating level of flow control needed to match forest hydrology.*

## Description

Ecology Stormwater Guidance includes flow-related performance standards
to protect receiving waters from degradation caused by changes in the
hydrologic regime due to development. These performance standards rely
on flow-duration matching, whereby flow durations from developed land
are required to match pre-developed flow-durations for a range of
discharge values. The flow duration standard is intended to prevent
flashy flows in receiving stream channels.

We developed an index representing the magnitude of change to the
flow-duration curve between flow thresholds. Thresholds were chosen
based on Ecologyâ€™s LID and Flow Control Standards (Department of
Ecology, 2014), which require flow-duration matching over the range
between 8 percent of the 2-year peak discharge (lower threshold of the
LID standard) up to the 50-year peak discharge (upper threshold of the
flow-control standard).

The flow discharge index is calculated by summing the discharge over the
simulation period between a high-flow and low-flow threshold. This index
is then applied to hru/grid combinations in the stormwater heatmap to
produce a spatially explicit mapping of flow alteration.

## Layer Access in Earth Engine

The javascript commands below can be used to access this layer within
the [Google Earth Engine Code
Editor](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground). A
Google Earth Engine account is required.

``` javascript
// Import the layer data dictionary
var data = require('users/stormwaterheatmap/apps:data/public')

// To view data dictionary, print to the console:
print('Data:', data)

//Get this layer from the layer data dictionary: 
var layer_name = data.rasters["Flow Duration Index"]
```

#### Viewing

Individual objects contain all the info used in the stormwater heatmap.
To add it to the map, add the layer object.

``` javascript
var display_image = layer_name.layer
Map.addLayer(display_image)
```

#### Analysis

To get the raw image data for analysis, access the `eeObject` key.

``` javascript
var raw_image = layer_name.layer.eeObject
Map.addLayer(raw_image,{},'Flow Duration Index')
```
