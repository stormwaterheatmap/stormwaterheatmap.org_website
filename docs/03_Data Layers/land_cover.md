*1-meter resolution land cover classification*

## Description

This layer provides automatically-derived land cover classifications of
the Puget Sound trough below 1,500 meters elevation. A six-class 1-meter
land cover layer was developed using the Na√Øve Bayes classifier (Google,
2019) and trained using a 10-meter land cover product from NOAA Coastal
Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) (NOAA C-CAP, 2018a). Other data combined
with this analysis includes water body and river polygons (Washington
Department of Natural Resources), shoreline polygons (Esri), over-water
structure polygons (Washington Department of Natural Resources), road
polygons buffered from centerlines (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016), and
building rooftops polygons (Microsoft, 2019). Accuracy was validated
accuracy with an observed land cover point dataset from the Washington
Department of Fish & Wildlife (Pierce, Jr., 2015).

## Layer Access in Earth Engine

The javascript commands below can be used to access this layer within
the [Google Earth Engine Code
Editor](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground). A
Google Earth Engine account is required.

``` javascript
// Import the layer data dictionary
var data = require('users/stormwaterheatmap/apps:data/public')

// To view data dictionary, print to the console:
print('Data:', data)

//Get this layer from the layer data dictionary: 
var layer_name = data.rasters["Land Cover"]
```

#### Viewing

Individual objects contain all the info used in the stormwater heatmap.
To add it to the map, add the layer object.

``` javascript
var display_image = layer_name.layer
Map.addLayer(display_image)
```

#### Analysis

To get the raw image data for analysis, access the `eeObject` key.

``` javascript
var raw_image = layer_name.layer.eeObject
Map.addLayer(raw_image,{},'Land Cover')
```
